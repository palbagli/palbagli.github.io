I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science ([LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics)) and affiliated with the Centre for Economic Performance ([CEP](https://cep.lse.ac.uk)).

My research combines **structural and reduced-form** approaches in **labor and applied microeconomics** to study how different **frictions and policies** shape **labor-market and educational outcomes**. I work on questions related to wage setting, labor-market power, and the evaluation of public policies. 

**I will be on the 2025-26 academic job market.** You can find my CV [here](https://palbagli.github.io/files/CV/Pinjas_Albagli_CV.pdf).

My **[job market paper](https://palbagli.github.io/files/jmp/job_apps.pdf)**, *Estimating Labor Market Power from Job Applications*, develops a framework to **measure monopsony power** from **job-application data** in settings where workers **apply to multiple jobs**. My other projects use administrative and survey data to study minimum-wage policy, student-loan design, maternity-leave reform, and early-childhood interventions.

Before joining the LSE, I completed a Master's in Economics at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile ([PUC-Chile](https://economia.uc.cl)) and held research and teaching positions at PUC-Chile, the University of Chile, the Central Bank of Chile, and CLAPES UC.
