I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science ([LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics)) and affiliated with the Centre for Economic Performance ([CEP](https://cep.lse.ac.uk)).

My research combines **structural and reduced-form** approaches in **labor and applied microeconomics** to study how different **frictions and policies** shape **labor-market and educational outcomes**. I work on questions related to wage setting, labor-market power, and the evaluation of public policies. 

**I am on the 2025-26 academic job market!** You can find my CV [here](https://palbagli.github.io/files/CV/Pinjas_Albagli_CV.pdf).

In my **[job market paper](https://palbagli.github.io/files/jmp/job_apps.pdf)**, I develop a structural framework to **measure monopsony power** from **job application data** in settings where workers **apply to multiple jobs**. My other projects combine administrative and survey data with reduced-form causal inference methods to study the returns to job mobility, the effect of minimum-wage policy on job contract types, the impact of student-loan design on [educational attainment(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econedurev.2025.102735)] and vocational choice, [maternity-leave](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecoj.12586) reform and human capital accumulation in early childhood, and other early childhood interventions.

Before joining the LSE, I completed a Master's in Economics at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile ([PUC-Chile](https://economia.uc.cl)). I held research/teaching positions at PUC-Chile, the University of Chile, the Central Bank of Chile, and CLAPES UC.
