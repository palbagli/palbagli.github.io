I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the [LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/economics). My research interests include Labor Economics, with a current focus on labor market power, and Applied Microeconomics, with a broader interest in the impact evaluation of public policy reforms on multiple educational, labor market, and developmental outcomes.

Before joining the LSE, I completed my Master's in Economics from [Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile](https://economia.uc.cl). I have held research and/or teaching positions at LSE, PUC-Chile, University of Chile, Central Bank of Chile, and CLAPES UC.
